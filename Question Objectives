Write three functions: 

placeOrder(),

processPayment(),  


shipProduct(). 


Return promises
Each of these functions should return a promise that resolves after a random amount of time (between 1 and 3 seconds).

Chain promises
Chain these promises together to simulate the process of placing an order, processing the payment, and shipping the product.

Error handling
Handle any errors that may occur during any step, ensuring the error is logged appropriately.
Bonus:

Add a success message after all steps have been completed: "Order has been placed, payment processed, and product shipped!".


If any step fails, the process should stop, and a failure message should be logged for the corresponding step.
