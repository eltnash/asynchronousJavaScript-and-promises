in javascript, a promise is an object that holds the future value of an async operation and that value can be used in future code thats dependent on that value.

so basically the promise is like saying i will hold the result from an async operation for future use so we have three things, the 
- async operation, 
      e.g setTimeouts, API calls and Event listeners

- the promise to hold the value
     creating the promises using the promise constructor

- the future use case i.e Handling the future value:

    You can use .then() to specify what should happen when the Promise is fulfilled.
    .catch() can be used to handle errors if the Promise is rejected.
    .finally() can be used to specify code that should run regardless of whether the Promise was fulfilled or rejected.
